# Singapore-GES-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Singapore’s Graduate Employment Survey (GES) dataset to analyze graduate employability and salary trends across universities, degree programs, and years using Python.


# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Singapore Graduate Employment Survey

## 🧾 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Singapore’s **Graduate Employment Survey (GES)** dataset.  
The goal is to analyze **graduate employability and salary trends** across different **universities, degree programs, and years** using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze overall and full-time employment trends
- Study salary distributions and growth patterns
- Compare employment outcomes across degree programs
- Identify relationships between employment rate and salary
- Practice real-world data cleaning and EDA techniques

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information related to:
- University and degree programs
- Overall employment rate
- Full-time permanent employment rate
- Mean and median monthly salaries
- Gross monthly salary percentiles
- Year-wise employment and salary statistics

> The raw dataset includes missing values and inconsistent formats, which are handled during preprocessing.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The following steps were performed:
- Removed whitespace from column names
- Replaced inconsistent missing values (`-`, `N/A`, empty strings)
- Converted salary and employment columns to numeric format
- Handled missing values using mean imputation
- Verified data types and saved a cleaned dataset
